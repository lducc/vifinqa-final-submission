"""Embed the table corpus and the questions with Qwen3-Embedding, on a free GPU.

The sparse ranker matches a row's wording. A question that names an item the
filing words differently never reaches the table, and no reranker can recover a
table that was never a candidate. This builds the other half of the first stage:
one vector per table, one per question, cosine between them.

The organizers published where this lands (their Table 4, Recall@10 over the
same corpus): BM25 47.41, BGE-M3 53.05, Qwen3-Embedding-4B 63.90, 8B 67.48; with
a reranker on top, 4B 80.19 and 8B 80.80. The 8B embedder is worth +3.58 alone
and +0.61 once a reranker follows it, so 4B is the size to index — the reranker
absorbs the difference and the index costs half as much to build and to hold.

Their BM25 is not ours, though. Theirs ranks flat over all 146k tables; ours
ranks inside reports a gate has already narrowed by ticker, year and scope. Most
of what dense retrieval buys them, the gate has already bought us, so expect the
margin here to be smaller than their table suggests. What it should still buy is
the gate's own misses, which nothing downstream can currently fix.

## Steps

1. `python scripts/export_table_texts.py` locally, then upload
   `output/dense/tables.jsonl` and `data/raw/vifinqa/questions/questions.jsonl`
   as a Kaggle Dataset.
2. New notebook, any 16 GB GPU, attach the dataset, paste this file in, run.
3. Run it once as it stands, with `LIMIT = 2000`. Five minutes, and the
   self-check at the end says whether this is an index or noise before three
   hours go into it.
4. Then set `LIMIT = 0` and run it again: 130,556 passages of 256 tokens through
   a 4B model is 2.7e17 FLOPs, near three hours at the 25 TFLOP/s a T4 sustains,
   inside a 12-hour session with room to spare.
5. Download `/kaggle/working/dense/` to `output/dense/`, then, before anything
   is scored:

       python scripts/audit_dense_overlap.py --dense output/dense

   That says where these candidates sit relative to the report gate, which is
   what decides whether the long scoring run is worth starting.

Nothing here reads a label. The passages come from the corpus and the queries
from the released question file, so the whole stage is reproducible by anyone
holding the public data.
