"""Kaggle GPU notebook: score candidate pairs with a Qwen3 reranker.

Paste into a notebook with a GPU accelerator and the exported pairs attached as
a dataset, edit the settings block, run. It writes scores.jsonl for
`scripts/apply_rerank_scores.py` to fuse locally.

To A/B two settings, paste it twice in one session and change the one line that
differs plus SCORES_PATH. Two runs in different sessions are not comparable.

Retrieval is untouched — only the order of already-retrieved candidates changes,
so discarding a run means deleting one file.

kaggle/README.md has the settings, the timings, and why each default is what it
is. Read it before changing one.
